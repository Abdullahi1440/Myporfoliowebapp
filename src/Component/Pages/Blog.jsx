        <p className=' flex text-center font-light text-2xl mt-3 '>My journey into software development began during my university years, where I majored in Computer Science. What started as curiosity quickly grew into a full-blown passion as I began building small web apps and contributing to open-source projects. Since then, I've worked on a variety of freelance and team-based projects, refining my skills in JavaScript, React, and backend technologies like Node.js and Express.
